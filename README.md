1. Makefile: Maya's Makefile for Gizmo with MacbookPro systype
2. axino2keV06_pk.dat is the power spectrum data for a 2keV WDM candidate (i.e. an example truncated power spectrum)
3. relative_transfer_truncated.ipynb has the best fit function to calculate the truncated transfer function (which is how the power spectrum changes under a WDM model)
